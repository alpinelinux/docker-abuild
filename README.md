# docker-abuild

[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/alpinelinux/docker-abuild/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/alpinelinux/docker-abuild)

A Docker-ised `abuild` for invocation from within an `aports/` tree. Attempts to auto-detect which branch of `aports/` is checked out, and use an appropriately based container for running `abuild`.

## Supported architectures

Currently supported architectures are (as reported by `uname -m`):

  * x86
  * x86_64
  * aarch64
  * armv6
  * armv7
  * armv7l
  * armv8

## Configuration

The `dabuild` script is generated from `dabuild.in` on `make dabuild`. This ensures synchronisation of volume names. By default, the `dabuild` script then uses the Docker image `mor1/dabuild`. To use a different image, set the `IMG` variable in the `Makefile` and then `make dabuild`.

On invocation from within an `aports/` tree, the script will determine the root of the tree (`.../aports/`) and bind mount it into the container at `/home/builder/aports`. It also bind mounts `$HOME/.abuild` for configuration and `.../aports/../packages` for `abuild` to output packages.

## Building without fetching

Per normal usage, if you use the `-K` switch, then the build, source, etc directories will be left alone on completion. If you then invoke as `dabuild build`, then the source will not be re-fetched -- useful when you wish to edit the source to debug a package build.

## Caching

The script attempts to support caching via named volumes. To turn on caching, invoke as

``` shell
DABUILD_CACHE=true abuild [options]
```

To clean the cache before continuing, invoke as

``` shell
DABUILD_CACHE=true DABUILD_CLEAN=true abuild [options]
```

## Known Issues

  * Docker doesn't support IPv6 well, so if a package's tests make use of IPv6 they may well fail. Observed with `community/libgdata` and [fixed](https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/pull/7597).
  * Due to what appears to be an issue with Docker for Desktop (at least on OSX), packages that untar symlinks to files that appear later in the tarball fail after untarring. Observed with `main/bash`. Workaround: just rerun the build, leaving the untarred files in place. [Issue raised](https://github.com/alpinelinux/docker-abuild/issues/21).
